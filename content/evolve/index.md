Join us in the heart of Crested Butte for a shared work experience. Located on
Elk Avenue in the midst of restaurants and coffee shops, with a balcony and
views of the avenue. We provide a quiet environment (headphones suggested) and
well-behaved dogs are welcome (dogs cannot be aggressive under any circumstances).
There are two conference rooms, high-speed fiber
wireless, comfortable Aeron-style office chairs, desks and couches.

## We Only Have Monthly Memberships

You can rent for a single month, starting on any day. Details [here](https://www.evolvework.co/evolve/#monthly-memberships-only).

## Open Desk (Each day, choose any available non-dedicated desk)

- High-season $300/month: If you begin your membership in May-September.
- Off-season $200/month: If you begin your membership any months except May-September. High-season members revert to this price in off-season, for as long as their membership is continuous.

## Dedicated Desk

- High-season $400/month: If you begin your membership in May-September.
- Off-season $300/month: If you begin your membership any months except May-September. High-season members revert to this price in off-season, for as long as their membership is continuous.

### This is a self-managed workspace. There will be some organizational inconveniences as we develop ourselves

### Please respect others in the space (See the note about Sound, below)

### Please turn off the heat & lock the door when you leave if no one else is on your side

### The building's condo rules do not allow bicycles in the building. Please lock up bicycles outside, in the rack

## Monthly Memberships Only

Billing is month-to-month, per person. Our minimum is one month (The overhead of
managing shorter times does not make sense for us). People come in for shorter
times but they still pay for a month. You can start your membership on any day.

This is a non-traditional space and is predominantly self managed,
so we don't have a staff person to handle drop-ins. If you want a
closed space, you might find one of the local hotels will serve your needs.

## Sound & Phone Use

An important part of a shared work space is being around other people and having
interesting conversations. We certainly want to encourage this, but in a way
that doesn't prevent focus when you need it.

If your job is nothing but taking and making phone calls or remote meetings,
it's not a good fit. Noise complaints are taken seriously. Disturbance is
something I want to be careful about, to make sure everyone has a good
experience.

Of course, people do need to sometimes have calls or remote meetings. The
primary concern is intrusiveness. We have people that do regular video
conferencing from their desks. This isn't intrusive because they wear headsets
(with built-in microphones right in front of the mouth) and can be relatively
quiet without impacting their meeting.

Headphones (noise-cancelling if you're sensitive) are a recommended addition to
your kit. Not only will they exclude sound, they indicate to others
that you're "in the zone" and would prefer to be left alone. The safest choice
to ensure you don't disturb others is a headset with a built-in microphone on
a stem directly in front of your mouth, like [this
one](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UXZQ42/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

If you think a call will be intrusive, we have spaces that can be used for such
calls:

- Two smaller conference rooms
- A larger training room
- The balcony
- The hallway between the two spaces (you can take a chair out there)

NOTE: Sometimes our west-side downstairs neighbor plays his music loud.
He said that if this disturbs anyone, feel free to come downstairs and tell him and he'll turn it down.

## Details

- High-speed wireless via a fiber connection via Internet Colorado. 100 Mbs/s
  both ways, and we can increase the speed when it becomes necessary. So far
  everyone is happy with the speed. The system has been upgraded to make it
  more resilient against outages.
- Memberships include 24/7 access via electronic locks connected to your smart
  phone.
- For security and safety, the space has recorded video surveilance.
- Invoicing is automatic and you may set up automatic payments as well.
- Well-behaved dogs are welcome. ***Dogs cannot be aggressive under any circumstances.***
- A contract, including a code of conduct, is coming.
- For internet security, we recommend using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) such as
  <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton VPN</a>.
- Two separate spaces on the same floor.
- Balcony overlooking Elk Avenue.
- Three conference rooms. If no one has reserved them, you may work or make calls from these.
